## Description

Taking a code quiz when I click the start button the timer starts and I am presented with a question. I answer a question and I am presented with another question. If I answer a question incorrectly then time is subtracted from the clock all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0. The game is over and I can save my initials and my score.
